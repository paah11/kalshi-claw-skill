## Features

### Market browsing

- `kalshi markets trending` — Top open markets by volume
- `kalshi markets search "query"` — Search by keyword
- `kalshi market <ticker>` — Market details with YES/NO prices

### Trading

- `kalshi buy <ticker> YES <amount>` — Buy YES contracts
- `kalshi buy <ticker> NO <amount>` — Buy NO contracts
- `kalshi sell <ticker> YES <amount>` — Sell YES contracts
- `kalshi sell <ticker> NO <amount>` — Sell NO contracts
- Direct market orders via Kalshi REST API v2

### Position tracking

- `kalshi positions` — All open positions with live P&L
- `kalshi position <ticker>` — Detailed single position view
- Positions stored locally in `~/.openclaw/kalshi/positions.json`

### Portfolio management

- `kalshi wallet status` — Balance and resting orders

### Hedge discovery

- `kalshi hedge scan` — Scan trending markets for hedges
- `kalshi hedge scan --query "topic"` — Topic-filtered scan
- `kalshi hedge analyze <t1> <t2>` — Deep-analyze a specific pair

LLM-powered contrapositive logic (via OpenRouter). Only logically necessary implications are accepted — correlations and "likely" relationships are rejected.

**Coverage tiers:** T1 ≥95% · T2 90–95% · T3 85–90%

## Setup

### 1. Configure credentials

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` after install:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "kalshi": {
        "enabled": true,
        "command": "node ~/.openclaw/skills/kalshi-claw-skill/dist/index.js",
        "env": {
          "KALSHI_API_KEY_ID": "your-api-key-id",
          "KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "/path/to/your/private_key.pem",
          "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-...",
          "KALSHI_ENV": "demo"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Where to get keys

- **Kalshi API key** — [kalshi.com/account/api](https://kalshi.com/account/api) → generate RSA key pair, save private key as `.pem`
- **OpenRouter key** — [openrouter.ai/settings/keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) (free tier available)

### 2. Run standalone (no OpenClaw)

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/kalshi-claw-skill
uv run python scripts/kalshi.py markets trending
```

---

## Example prompts (OpenClaw / Claude Desktop)

```
What's trending on Kalshi?
Show me details for market INXD-23DEC31-B4000
What's my Kalshi balance?
Buy $50 YES on INXD-23DEC31-B4000
Find hedging opportunities on Kalshi
Run hedge scan on Kalshi limit 15
Show my Kalshi positions
Sell my YES position on INXD-23DEC31-B4000
```

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` | Yes (trading) | Kalshi API key ID |
| `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | Yes (trading) | Path to RSA private key PEM |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Yes (hedge) | OpenRouter API key for LLM |
| `KALSHI_ENV` | No | `demo` or `prod` (default: `demo`) |

## How it works

### Authentication

Kalshi uses **RSA-signed requests**. Every API call is signed with your private key — no secrets are transmitted, only the signature.

Generate a key pair:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out kalshi_private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in kalshi_private.pem -pubout -out kalshi_public.pem
```

Upload `kalshi_public.pem` to [kalshi.com/account/api](https://kalshi.com/account/api) and keep `kalshi_private.pem` safe.

### Hedge discovery flow

1. Fetch open markets (filtered by topic if `--query` given)
2. Generate all market pairs
3. Send each pair's questions to the LLM for logical implication analysis
4. Filter results by coverage tier
5. Display actionable hedge opportunities with cost estimates

**Coverage tiers:**

| Tier | Coverage | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| T1 (HIGH) | ≥95% | Near-arbitrage — near-certain logical implication |
| T2 (GOOD) | 90–95% | Strong hedge |
| T3 (MODERATE) | 85–90% | Decent hedge, some residual risk |
| T4 (LOW) | <85% | Speculative (filtered out by default) |

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named kalshi_client"

Run from the skill directory with `uv`:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/kalshi-claw-skill
uv run python scripts/kalshi.py markets trending
```

### "Authentication failed"

- Verify `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` matches the key ID shown on kalshi.com
- Ensure `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` points to the correct `.pem` file
- Check that the public key is uploaded to your Kalshi account

### "uv: command not found"

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

### Hedge scan finds 0 results

- Try a more specific `--query` to narrow the market set
- Try `--min-tier 4` to see weaker relationships
- Some topics genuinely have no logically implied pairs — that's correct behavior
